        <td align="justify"><font size="5">As this quarter is about to end, I must say that this quarter had been a really interesting experience for me. I learned a lot of things about ICT and coding things! And with the use of these knowledge I had the ability to create my own webpage; this E-Portfolio.<br><br> Making this E-Portfolio really gave me the opportunity to expand my creativity and knowledge about coding and ICT related stuff. Though, I must say that I am not really proud of my work. <br><br> So, with the next quarters, I will do my best and create better designs, codes, and excel in written works and performance tasks. I will look forward into learning more about this subject, honing my skills, and discovering newer things in the upcoming experiences that awaits us.</font></td>
