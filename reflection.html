            <h1 class="head">My Reflection for 2nd Quarter!</h1>

            <p class="fp">My reflection throughout this quarter is that I had quite the experience in coding this webpage in many ways. I downloaded a bunch of coding apps, watched many videos, applying what I learned through discussions, and skimming through every PPTs. <br> <br> Ever since I learned CSS, I started to use it a lot. It helps me apply my imagination more with a broader set of elements and attributes.
                I must say that it was REALLY confusing, because you get really lost when you have an error, or even get a mental block because of the amount of symbols and commas you see on your screen. But I will also feel relieved when I finally fix that error. <br><br>And this experience somehow manages to sum up my experience throughout this quarter. I look forward into learning more strategies and ways to code more!
