            <p class="fp">Learning JavaScript in Grade 9 was an exciting experience that introduced me to coding more. At first, JavaScript seemed challenging, but as I practiced, I realized how good it can be for creating interactive web pages.

                One of the things I learned was variables, loops, and functions. Variables helped me store and manipulate data, loops made repetitive tasks easier, and functions allowed me to organize code efficiently. Writing basic scripts to display messages using alert, manipulate elements, and handle events like button clicks showed me how JavaScript can be used for alot of things.
                <br><br>
                Debugging was another thing I learned. I encountered errors often, but using trebEdit, or Visual Studio Code to check for mistakes and fix them helped me become more aware of what I'm doing right or wrong.
                
                Overall, learning JavaScript in Grade 9 programming really made coding more understandable and really interesting. It can be really confusing sometimes when your browser doesn't work or load; but relieving when you've finally found that ONE single error ruining your entire browser! It showed me that coding aren't as hard as those you see in movies—anyone can do it if you just practice.

                ICT Grade 9 in LPSCI had also been a memorable school year for me, especially when we have supportive, loyal friends, and loving, caring, funny, and one of the best ICT teachers in my life: Miss Uminga! Thank you for this memorable school year Ms!<br><br><br><br><br></p>
